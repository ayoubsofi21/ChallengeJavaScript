# ChallengeJavaScript
Depends on your experience really. If you're a beginner, you don't really want exercises but rather 'projects' that you can complete so you're familiar with the whole cycle and the syntax.

But learning the syntax isn't really the challenge in Javascript. The challenge comes from learning the libraries, frameworks like React, and data structures.

The "exercises" as you put it, are often more like logic puzzles that need to be solved in Javascript. This is useful for people who already are familiar with Javascript syntax and want to get better at coming up with algorithms on the spot. A beginner would immediately get stuck and learn nothing even if the solution was provided.

So with all that said, and assuming you're new to Javascript, I would recommend following the free Scrimba tutorial. It's 7 hours of material and you work in an integrated environment which means you can pause the instructor's video and immediately take over the code that's been written. It's a fun way to start:

This is the way. Set out to develop projects. You will learn way more about the practical implications of JS and you will avoid the lite code problems often presented by exercise sites. Here are some project ideas to get you started that are relatively easy for a beginner:

-A unit converter where the user inputs a number and a unit of measurement and selects a unit of measurement to convert it to (eg grams to kilograms)

-tip calculator where the user inputs the bill amount and gets a 20% tip recommendation

-reflex tester where the user clicks on randomly appearing shapes and the app keeps track of their time

I disagree and would say you actually want both exercises and projects. It's hard to tackle projects with out first understanding how loops or functions work right? You need some exercises to challenge your understanding of how to use those constructs.

But learning the syntax isn't really the challenge in Javascript. The challenge comes from learning the libraries, frameworks like React, and data structures.

The challenge isn't learning libraries and frameworks, but from learning programming fundamentals deeply and thinking computationally by solving problems aka doing exercises and projects that challenge your understanding. When you understand those fundamentals deeply learning frameworks and libraries isn't so bad.

The "exercises" as you put it, are often more like logic puzzles that need to be solved in Javascript. This is useful for people who already are familiar with Javascript syntax and want to get better at coming up with algorithms on the spot.

Again this is important because programming is about solving problems and thinking logically.
